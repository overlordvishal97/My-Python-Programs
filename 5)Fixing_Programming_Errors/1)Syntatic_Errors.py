#In python we have two types of errors.
#They are syntax errors and exceptions.
#lets see an example for syntax error.
print(1)
int(9)
int 9
#int is a function so functions should be in parenthesis.
# the error can be resolved by adding brackets.
print(2)
#the print is a statement so it shouldn't need brackets as return statement 
# but if you add brackets then the error will be resolved. 
print 3

#so syntax errors are easy to fix.
