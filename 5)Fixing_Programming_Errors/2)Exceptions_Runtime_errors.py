#Ardits error showed that the line 4 print function has an invalid syntax error  
# so i am going to go with that so you might surprised by the error  
# cause you don't see any error in the line 4 but it is showing error  
# so all you have to do is check the code and see any thing is wrong then 
# you might find that the third line of print statement is not closed. so that was the error
#But in my pc it should correctly which line was causing the error.
#The python first checks for the syntax errors.thats why this codes syntax error was first found.
#Syntax errors are parsing errors python checks if the code is syntatically correct and
# it is following the syntatic rules.
# the next error will be Type error.
#In order to correct the error you just have to change the datatype of the object in the statement.
#Next will be name error this error comes when the object is not defined in the code.
#this error can be resolved by defining the object
#there is will be an error when you try to divide any object with zero. which called "Zero division error".

#Quiz on Errors.
#which is in exercise 132 if you want for reference.
