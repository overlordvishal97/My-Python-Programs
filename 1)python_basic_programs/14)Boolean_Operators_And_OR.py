#And is used to check if two conditions are met at the same time
x = 1

if x == 1 and y == 1:
    print("Yes")
else:

#that will return yes since   x == 1 and y == 1 are both true 

#you can also check if one of two conditions are met using an 'or' operator:
x = 1 
y = 1 

if x == 1 or y == 2:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
    
#that will return yes since at least one of the conditions is True. In this case x == 1 is True.
